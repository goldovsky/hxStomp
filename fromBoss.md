### To add in banks

- A Vibrato pedal combined in parallel with a dry signal will transform into a CHORUS effect ? note that somewhere and try what tremolo can do (or check effect from meris pedals)
- SlapbackDelay
- Short 1 repeat delay (dotted 8th delay)
- Andy timmons blue driver boss full gain but roll back guitar volume for warm clean

- octave down 50% mix and reverb
- use delay pedal as reverb?
- 80's Shred (big delay with VH4 canal 4)
- DistroVerb (hi distortion & big reverb)
